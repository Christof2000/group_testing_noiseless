# Noiseless Group Testing

A project where noiseless group testing is explored. Multiple algorithms are imlpemented and their performances are compared on different metrics.
The algorithms implemented:
- COMP: Combinatorial orthogonal matching pursuit
- DD: Definite defectives
- Linear Programming relaxations
- SCOMP: Sequential Combinatorial orthogo-nal matching pursuit
